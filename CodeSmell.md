| [Bloaters](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells/bloaters)                     | Bloaters are code, methods and classes that have increased to such gargantuan proportions that they are hard to work with. Usually these smells do not crop up right away, rather they accumulate over time as the program evolves (and especially when nobody makes an effort to eradicate them). |                                           |               |
